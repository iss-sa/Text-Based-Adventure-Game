Stay in Betwixt Town
You offer to stay and look after her manor as gratitude for
her hospitality. She agrees and immediately hires you.
She comes back each summer and lives in Riverfoot Keep 
during the winters. She dies after several years and 
you learn she added you into her will.
You’ve inherited everything from her! 
As a rich man you live most of your time comfortably in 
Betwixt town with frequent visits to your old home. 
You still love traveling, but now you do it in luxury. 
You never marry but still die loved by many. 
You possibly die as a consequence of your short exposure to 
the fumes at the Dragon’s mouth.
