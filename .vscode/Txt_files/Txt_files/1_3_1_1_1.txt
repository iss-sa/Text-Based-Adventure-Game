Zakore Desert.
Zakore Desert is a perfect circle of hot dry land. As soon as you step in you can’t step out on your own anymore. 
You have to first find the wizard, but the wizard cannot be found without a map. 
You travelled 4 long days, when you finally reach Zakoria, the town surrounding the wizard’s tower. 
After befriending the towns folk and living in Zakoria for a few weeks you learn to love this town. 
It takes you several more months to finally convince the Wizard Zakore to take you as an apprentice. 
In the decades to follow you become a prominent and powerful wizard. You travel the land to help unfortunate villages and families. 
You become known as "{name} the Kind-hearted". You also frequently visit you parents.
