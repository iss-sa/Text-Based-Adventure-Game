(1) Test your strength by swimming across the much wider part of the river to the Giants of Old mountains
(2) You bought a map of the Zakore Desert in Trollore, who frequently trade with the wizard who created the desert and lives there. 
    You decide to find him.
Work in Trollore.
You start working in Trollore as a constructionist. 
As you start to learn their culture you are extremely glad you didn’t choose to steal from then. 
If you had been caught, the punishment would have been death - a bit severe in your oppinion. 
Every morning you have to join the other Trollorians to church and pray to their goddess. 
Over the next months you get extremely strong and also learn how to swim. 
As you leave you don’t even need a passenger boat to bring you across as you can just easily swim the distance. 
>> What is your next move?
