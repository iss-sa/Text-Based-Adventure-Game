(1) Go into the village tavern
(2) Steal something and immediately leave the village
You steal the bag.
You palm one of the rocks on the ground beside you, and abruptly swing it towards the boys head. 
You struck him hard, he falls back, quickly bleeding out and you grab the bag. 
Then you search the body, finally finding a small pouch full of coins from his inside pocket. 
You run away from the Keep and towards the next village. 
As you arrive in Dourphe 2 weeks later you again have barely any food left.
>> What do you do?
