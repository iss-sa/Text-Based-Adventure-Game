The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
Marry Lord Pjoter.
Lady Yanabél is inconsolable at first, but after several months you are close friends again. 
You and Lord Pjoter live a blissful life in the Keep. 
You only cause a scandal once when you adopt 3 children from the lower class. 
Both of you work steadily towards a better future for the lower class. 
The progress is slow, but it fills you with purpose. 
All in all you live a long happy life. 
You die from cancer possibly due to your short exposure to the fumes at the Dragon’s mouth.
