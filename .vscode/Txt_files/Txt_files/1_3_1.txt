(1) You decide to steal them both - with your height you can probably sneak into a shop and out before anyone noticing
(2) You’ve never stolen something before, you should probably not risk it, and rather look for some work to earn money
You go to Trollore.
To go to Trollore you need to board a passenger ship that will take you to the island. 
As you see the price of a one way trip you start getting second thoughts. 
You won’t have any money left to buy you more food. You buy a ticket to Trollore anyways. 
As you arrive you notice how big and muscular everyone here is. Maybe they are trolls? 
Or just very strong humans. 
In any case you feel tiny in comparison. You don’t want to stay in Trollore for too long, 
but you need food and another ticket out of here. 
>> What do you do next?
