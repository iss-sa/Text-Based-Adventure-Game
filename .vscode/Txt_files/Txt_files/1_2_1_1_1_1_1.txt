(1) Whatever the cost, you try to steal the bag from the boy
(2) You join the crew for the offer to get rich
Continue with your adventure.
Exhausted you stumble along the road. 
You decided days ago that you should have stolen from the townsfolk. 
If you had, you wouldn’t be so close to death now. 
You lost track of the days you have already spent walking through the mountains. 
Eventually you arrive at the Silph Mountain’s Keep. You are in the bad part of town and close to starvation. 
A malicious looking young boy of maybe 15 approaches you. 
He offers you a chance to get rich if you help him and his crew out with a job. 
He holds a big bag of food infront of you as first payment.
>> What do you do?
