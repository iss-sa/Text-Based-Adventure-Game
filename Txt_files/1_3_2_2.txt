The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!

You go into the desert.
As soon as you step into the desert, the mountains 
disappear from your view. 
How can that be? Some kind of magic? 
You only see endless desert, no matter where you look. 
Panicked you run back the way you came from, 
but you canâ€™t get back anymore. 
You wander aimlessly through the desert for a couple of days. 
The heat and lack of water kill you.
