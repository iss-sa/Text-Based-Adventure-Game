(1) Those are just stupid rumours, you still want to go to Trollore.
(2) You changed your mind, you don’t want to go to Trollore anymore.
Right towards Trollore.
Trollore is a Volcano island. 
Folk say that Trollore gets its name from the inhabitants, 
who are rumoured to be trolls. But you are not sure if you believe that. 
You decide to find out for yourself. 
But during your walk, you start to get doubts.
What if there are really trolls there?
Ugly, violent and dirty beasts that would immediately challenge you 
to a duel and kill you. You are scared.

>> What do you think?
