Work in Shlaph
You start working at the port. 
During your time there you learn how to repair ships 
and how to catch and prepare fish. 
You also become an excellent swimmer. 
You talk a lot to the townsfolk and learn about a reclusive 
settlement. It's called Oak Valley and is hidden by a mountain 
ring called the Giants of Old. It is only a few days travel 
from Shlaph and you decide to find it one day. 
After 4 months you finally feel prepared to continue your journey 
and find Oak Valley.
A week later you arrive, and itâ€™s beautiful. 
There is a big lake right in the middle called The Passage. 
You settle down in Oak Valley and never truly leave again. 
You do go to see your parents occasionally.
