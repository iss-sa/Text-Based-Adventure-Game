(1) You find the wizard.
(2) Test your strength by swimming across a much wider river.
Find work in Trollore.
You start working in Trollore as a constructionist. 
As you start to learn their culture you are extremely 
glad you didn’t choose to steal from then. If you had been caught, 
the punishment would have been death - a bit severe in your opinion. 
Every morning you have to join the other Trollorians to church and 
pray to their goddess. 
One day you find a map of the Zakore Desert, and find out Trollore
trades with the wizard who created the desert and lives right in
the middle. You buy the map. 
Over the next months you get extremely strong and also learn how to swim. 
As you leave you don’t even need a passenger boat to bring 
you across as you can just easily swim the distance. 

>> What is your next move?
