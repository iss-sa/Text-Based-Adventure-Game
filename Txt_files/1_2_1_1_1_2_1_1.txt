(1) Steal something and immediately leave the village.
(2) Go into the village tavern.
You steal the bag.
You palm one of the rocks on the ground beside you, 
and abruptly swing it towards the boys head. 
You struck him hard and he falls back, quickly bleeding out.
You grab the bag and search the body, finally finding a small pouch 
full of coins from his inside pocket. 
You run away from the Keep and towards the next village. 
As you arrive in Dourphe 2 weeks later you again have barely 
any food left.
