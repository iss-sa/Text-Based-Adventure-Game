Right.
You decide to turn right at the next possibility. 
After a week of travel you stumble across Silph Mountain’s Keep. 
You are so tired of travelling aimlessly through the mountains. 
You decide to start working in the keep as a guard. 
You stay much longer than you thought and manage to 
get promoted quickly. 
Over the decades you gather a lot of power in the Keep. 
Under your influence in the Justice System it improves a lot. 
You are most known for making the Silph’s Dungeons more humane. 
You die after an accomplished life. 
You become known as "{name} the Lawgiver". 
Unfortunately you never had the time to spare to go visit 
your parents again.
