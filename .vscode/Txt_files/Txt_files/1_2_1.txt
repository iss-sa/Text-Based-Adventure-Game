(1) Risk the road through the canyon
(2) Risk diverging from the path
Around the mountain
You enter the mountain range called Kebírghe. 
It’s a dark and lonely place, the road you follow doesn't seem often used. 
After a week you stand infront of a deep canyon, the bottom is barely visible. 
The road seems to continue through it, but it doesn’t look safe.
You are scared of falling to your death, but you are also scared of leaving the road. 
>> What should you do?
