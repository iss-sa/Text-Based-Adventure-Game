The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
Join crew for the heist.
You decide to join the boy (called Trick) and his crew, eventhough you don’t him. 
The crew plans rob Silph Mountain Keep’s treasury. 
You have to guard the exit strategy and get 20% of the treasure. 
Surprisingly most of you manage to pull of the heist more or less unharmed. 
However, Trick rats makes you the scapegoat! The authorities throw you into the Silph’s Dungeon. 
It's notorious for the cruelty towards its prisoners. 
You die in a cold, dark and damp cell from hypothermia, starvation and torture.
