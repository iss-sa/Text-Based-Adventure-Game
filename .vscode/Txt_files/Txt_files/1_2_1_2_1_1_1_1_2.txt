The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
Stay in Betwixt Town
The old Lady hires you to look after her manor. She comes back each summer and lives in Riverfoot Keep during the winters. 
She dies after several years. You learn she added you into her will and you’ve inherited everything from her. 
As a rich man you live most of your time comfortably in Betwixt town with frequent visits to your old home. 
You still love traveling, but now you do it in luxury. You never marry but still die loved by many. 
You possibly die from repercussions of your short exposure to the fumes at the Dragon’s mouth.
