The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
Assemble your own crew.
With the little money you have you assemble a crew for a 
daring adventure. The best part of it is, YOU are the captain! 
After 2 weeks on an old boat with shady shipmates you realise: 
You should have listened to the experienced merchants. 
Just as they predicted the currents get you just before the mermaids pass. 
You had no chance. 
No one survives the crash against the high cliffs of Uriella.
