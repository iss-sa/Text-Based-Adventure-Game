(1) A few more days of no human contact won’t make a difference. 
(2) You are so tired of traveling all alone.
Leave Hyghel.
You would feel guilty to accept the offer, so you decide to leave Hyghel.
The goodbyes are painful, but you promise to come back to visit. 
You follow the Northern Way, a long, long road straight 
through the Old Wilds. It is rarely used nowadays and you are on 
the road alone for 9 weeks. 
You have no issues with getting food because of your new skills.
However, 9 weeks without human contact starts to consume 
more and more of your sanity. 
Finally you see 2 signs: “Fharswith 40km” and “Riverfoot Keep 160km”.

>> What do you think?
