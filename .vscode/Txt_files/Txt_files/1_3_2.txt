(1) You find a way around the desert - You don’t trust this unnatural occurrence
(2) You are too curious - Anyway, you can always easily return by orienteering yourself by the mountains
Change Direction.
You turn north and walk along the water to find a way across the water. After a week you arrive at a bridge called Troll’s Pass. 
With extreme caution you slowly cross it, but no Trolls jump up to attack you.You arrive safely on the other side. 
You start to run low on food and really should find a settlement to restock. 
Suddenly you stand before a desert. It’s completely out of place, there is a clear cut line between fresh gras and hot sand. 
>> What do you do?
