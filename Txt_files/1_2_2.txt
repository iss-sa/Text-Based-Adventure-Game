(1) You are intimidated - you just want to be home in your comfortable bed.
(2) You feel homesick, but you also feel very excited.
To the Peak.
You have always wanted to reach the peak and find out 
how far you could see from up there.
After foraging all the food the Scarlet Expanse can give, 
you start to hike. 
It’s difficult, and the blisters are killing you, but you don’t give up. 
After almost a week you finally reach the top. 
You notice how tiny the Scarlet Mountain is compared to the 
dark and dangerous mountains behind it. 
You never realised how big the world could be.
You turn towards your home and can barely see it in the distance.
