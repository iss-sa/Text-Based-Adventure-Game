(1) Risk the shorter way without a guide
(2) Go around and risk running out of food
Join a merchant ship to Port Fallow.
After a few days of journey you arrive at Port Fallow. It’s much dirtier and uglier than the previous port and you don’t want to linger. 
You learn the closest village is Hyghel, but you are advised against going the direct route. 
The direct route very dangerous and you are easily lost without a guide (who you can’t afford anymore).
 But the way around the jungle along the water takes several weeks without a horse (which you also can’t afford).
You are not sure if you will be able to hunt anything successfully when your food runs out. 
>> Which way do you go?
