(1) Go right towards Acropolis
(2) Go left towards Uriella Fortress
Walk on
The fumes make you lightheaded, eventhough you haven't breathed them in much. 
You quickly move away from the fog and travel up the next mountain. 
After several more days you finally reach a road! It’s well travelled and you ask a merchant where the road leads to. 
He explains: To the right is the biggest city in the country - Acropolis. 
To the left lies the Uriella, with the richest Fortress in Kebírghe .
>> Which way do you go?
