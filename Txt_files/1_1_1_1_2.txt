(1) The memory of you old home is still too strong, you can't stay.  
(2) You decide to have a new life here. 
Walk around the jungle along the water.
It takes you a month of hard work to properly learn how to survive in the 
wild alone. During that time you start loving Hyghel. 
You often go exploring the Jungle with your new friends here.
You almost feel at home here, especially in the family who took you in 
when you arrived. They love you too and want you to permanently stay 
with them. They offer to adopt you. 

>> What will you do?
