The End!(Happy)
(K)Press K

Listen to the rebels.
After listening to the rebels for half an hour you have
learned a lot about the Keep and you finally decide to go. 
Just as you start moving, the rebels notice you and attack. 
You manage to defend yourself quite well with the spear, but
in the end the rebels are able to take you as a prisoner.
However, they are impressed with your fighting skills and 
quickly recruit you for their cause - You become one of The Starved. 
You die several years later in an assassination attempt against 
the rulers of Riverfoot Keep.
