The End!(Happy)
(K) Press K!

Work at the Dragonâ€™s Wall.
The work pays well and you decide to stay. 
You find 2 lovers and start your new life in Uriella. 
You visit your old home as frequently as possible, and 
you are happy with your life. You live with your 2 spouses and 
5 children at the cliff, with a view to the sea. 
The only problem: You were exposed to the fumes of 
Dragon's mouth for too long. 
You get severely sick 2 and a half decades later and die.
