The End!(Happy)
(K) Press K!

Back home.
You found out dangerous adventuring is not your style and
you go back home. You still end up being the adventurer of the village. 
As you age you become more comfortable with travelling a bit further,
but you always come back home, where you are a proud {gender} 
of 3 healthy children. 
You live a happy life working on the farm.
