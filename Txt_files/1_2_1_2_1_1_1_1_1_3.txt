The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!

Run away.
You donâ€™t want to marry either, and you are sick of Riverfoot Keep!
You run away in the cover of night and towards the Starved Marshes. 
You heard rumors of rebels living there and want to join them. 
You become a spy for The Starved. 
With your information the rebels attack the upper class a decade 
later in a bloody revolution. 
You die fighting for your cause. 
You never get to live to see the end result of the revolution.
