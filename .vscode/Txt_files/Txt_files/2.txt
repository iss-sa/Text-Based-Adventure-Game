The End!(Happy)
(K) Press K!
You just can’t do it. You are too afraid of the unknown. You roll over and softly cry yourself to sleep.
In the years and decades to come, you never leave the village.
Managing the farm is tough work and you never get a day off. 
You have a spouse, are a {gender} to two children and also have a dog. 
You are content with life.
