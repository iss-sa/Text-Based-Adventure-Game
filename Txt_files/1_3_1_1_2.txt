The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!

Swim towards the mountains called The Giants of Old.
After several weeks of travel you arrive at the river. 
It looks so wide! But there in the distance you see the 
giant mountains. You start swimming and at first everything is 
going well. However, soon you notice that your muscles arenâ€™t strong 
enough to swim against the sea currents! 
They pull you farther and farther out to south sea. 
After a whole day of struggling you are too exhausted to continue
holding yourself over water. You drown.
