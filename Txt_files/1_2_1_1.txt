(1) Wait for the perfect moment 
(2) Jump immediately  
Follow the road into the canyon.
The Road must lead to somewhere, probably a village or something. 
You canâ€™t risk being lost in the KebÃ­rghe -

Suddenly, you feel the stone giving away from under you! 
You notice a ridge bellow you that you could probably jump to. 

>> Quickly, decide!
