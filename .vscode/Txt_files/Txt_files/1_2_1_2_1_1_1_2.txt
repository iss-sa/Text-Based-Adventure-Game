The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
Work at the Dragonâ€™s Wall.
The work pays well and you decide to stay. You find 2 lovers and start your new life in Uriella. 
You visit your old home as frequently as possible, and you are content with your life. You live with your 2 spouses and 5 children at the cliff, with a view to the sea. 
The only issue: You were exposed to the fumes of Dragon's mouth for too long. 
You get severely sick 2 decades later and die.
