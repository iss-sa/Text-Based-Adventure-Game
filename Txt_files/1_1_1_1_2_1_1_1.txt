The End!(Happy)
(K) Press K!
Listen to the rebels.
After listening to the rebels for half an hour you 
learned a lot about the Keep and you finally decide to go. 
Just as you start moving, the rebels notice you and attack. 
The rebels quickly take you as a prisoner. 
You keep your small knife hidden, and manage to use it 
several nights later to successfully escape. 
You decide to go back to Hyghel immediately along the North Road. 
However, after 9 more weeks of no human contact you are 
barely sane anymore. 
Your foster family takes good care of you, but you never 
return to how you were before.
