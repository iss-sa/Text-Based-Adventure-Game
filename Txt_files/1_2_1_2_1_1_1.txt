(1) Continue your travels.
(2) Accept the job offer - You’ve had enough adventuring for now.
Go to Uriella Fortress.
Uriella Fortress is right at the edge of the High Cliffs. 
The view is breathtaking. 
To the north you see the Old Wilds and to the South-West 
the Red Sea. You find out that the chasm in the north is the one you 
saw previously. It’s called the Dragon’s Mouth. 
You are very tired and not sure if you want to continue with 
your journey anymore. 
You get offered a guards position at the Dragon’s Wall. 
You would have to monitor the activity of the fumes. 
If neccessary you have to alert the townsfolk if they have to 
evacuate the lower ring.
