The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
Shorter path to Hyghel.
How hard can walking in a straight line really be? You try walking straight to Hyghel. 
You quickly realize that the grassland you grew up in is very different from a jungle. 
It doesnâ€™t take long until you start panicking. Hacking through the dense foliage you have no idea where 
you are nor which way you are going anymore. Without proper sleep your strength runs out. 
In the end you die painfully and get eaten by wild animals.
