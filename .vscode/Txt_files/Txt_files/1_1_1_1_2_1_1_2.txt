The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
Leave the rebels behind.
You decide the risk isn't worth it. You continue on the road to Riverfoot Keep. 
You are completely unprepared when 5 soldiers stop you on the way. 
They are very suspicious of you because you arrived from the starving marshes and suspect you to be a rebel. 
They wonâ€™t listen to what you say in your defense and arrest you. 
You are taken as a prisoner to Riverfoot Keep to work in one of their gold mines. 
You never leave the mines while you are alive.
