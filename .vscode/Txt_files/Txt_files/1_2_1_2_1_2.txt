The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
Check out the Chasm
The fog makes you dizzy, but you don’t turn back. 
You manage to go to the very edge and look into the whole. 
You can’t see very far down, because of the fog is too dense. 
After several seconds you faint and fall into the chasm. 
The fumes kill you before you reach the bottom.
