The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
The Golden Goose Tavern.
You ordered some cheap food and a strong drink, which you quickly finish. 
You order another strong drink. And another. And another. And another.... 
You end up joining the village drunkards. You never got over the murder you commited. 
You died alone, while passed out behind the tavern besides the garbage.
