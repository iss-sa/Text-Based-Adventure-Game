(1) You’ve never stolen something before, and shouldn't risk it now.
(2) You decide to try to steal more food and a ticket.
You go to Trollore.
To go to Trollore you need to board a passenger ship that 
will take you to the island. As you see the price of a one way 
trip you notice you won’t have any money left to buy more food. 
You get a ticket to Trollore anyways. 
As you arrive you notice how big and muscular everyone here is. 
Maybe they are trolls after all? Or just very strong humans. 
In any case you feel tiny in comparison. Everybody keeps bumping
into you because they don't notice you. You don’t want to stay in 
Trollore for too long, but you need food and another ticket out of here. 

>> What do you do next?
