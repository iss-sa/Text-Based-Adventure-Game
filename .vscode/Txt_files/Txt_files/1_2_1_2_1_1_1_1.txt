You board a passenger ship and travel east along the Sea Serpent. It's a river conecting the Red Sea with the South Sea. 
You disembark the ship at the last stop - Betwixt Town. It seems to be a holiday resort for the rich.

You befriend an old Lady and she takes you in. After the summer she asks you if you want to join her in Riverfoot Keep for the Winter.
