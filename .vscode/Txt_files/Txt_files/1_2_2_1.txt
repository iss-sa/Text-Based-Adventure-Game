The End!(Happy)
(K) Press K!
Back home.
You go back home as the adventurer of the village. 
As you age you become more comfortable with travelling a little bit, but you always come back home. 
You found out dangerous adventuring is not your style 
and you become a proud {gender} of 3 healthy children. 
You live a happy life working on the farm.
