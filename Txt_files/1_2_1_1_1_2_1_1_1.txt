The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!

Leave the village.
You break into an empty house and steal their food, 
all the money you can find and some new clothes. 
When the owners come back you fight them and then run away 
on their horse.
After only a couple of days on the road you arrive at Acropolis. 
It's the biggest city you have ever seen!
It doesnâ€™t take long for you to join one of the street gangs. 
The rest of your life is lived in crime. 
You die brutally during a turf war with other street gangs.
