The End!(Happy)
(K) Press K!
Listen to the rebels.
After listening to the rebels for half an hour you learned a lot about the Keep. You finally decide to go. 
Just as you move to go, the rebels notice you and attack. The rebels take you as a prisoner. 
You keep your small knife hidden, and manage to use it to successfully escape several nights later. 
You decide to go back to Hyghel immediately along the North Road. 
However, after 9 more weeks of no human contact you are barely sane anymore. 
Your foster family takes good care of you, but you never return to how you were before.
