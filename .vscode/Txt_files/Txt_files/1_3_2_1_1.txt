(1) You want to know more about the nurse

Eat the berries
You eat a big handful of the berries and then continue walking. 
The morning after consumption you notice it: Severe stomach cramps have you gasping on the floor. 
Diarrhea comes shortly after, as does the vomiting.

In a delirious high-fever state you believe the nurse assigned to you is an angel saving you. 
>> As you recover, what are your thoughts?
