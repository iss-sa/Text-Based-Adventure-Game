(1) You really like the old Lady and wish to join her.
(2) Stay - You donâ€™t want to overtax her hospitality.
Continue travelling.
You board a passenger ship and travel east along the Sea Serpent. 
It's a river conecting the Red Sea with the South Sea. 
You disembark the ship at the last stop - Betwixt Town. 
It seems to be a holiday resort for the rich. 
Especially for the upper class of Riverfoot Keep go there 
frequently. You befriend an old Lady and she takes you in. 
After the summer she asks you if you want to join her in 
Riverfoot Keep for the Winter.
