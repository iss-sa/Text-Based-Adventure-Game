The End!(Happy)
(K) Press K!

Go to Acropolis.
Acropolis is the biggest city you have ever seen! 
You walk through the busy marketplace and along stone roads and 
end up before the university. 
You are in awe. In that moment you decide you need to go there. 
Unfortunately you don’t have the proper education, 
nor the money. You work for years, first in the bad part of 
the city, but slowly working yourself up to better paying jobs. 
You study each night to be able to qualify for the 
Acropolis University of Magic. Finally, after 8 years, you pass 
the entrance exam and even get a scholarship! 
During your life you become one of the most prominent figures of 
the city. With your help the city’s crime rates drop to an all time low. 
You become known as "{name} the Brilliant". 
You live a happy life in the city, with frequent trips to the close 
ally of Uriella Fortress. You also manage to sometimes visit your old home. 
You die after a happy and accomplished life.
