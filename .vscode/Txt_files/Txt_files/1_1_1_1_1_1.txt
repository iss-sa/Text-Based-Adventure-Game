(1) You are so tired of traveling for now and you just want to finally be able to talk to people
(2) You reckon a few more days of no human contact won’t make a difference anymore at this point
Leave Hyghel.
The goodbyes are painful, but you promise to come back to visit. 
You follow the Northern Way, a long, long road straight through the Old Wilds. 
It is rarely used nowadays and you are on the road alone for 9 weeks. 
You have no issues with getting food because of your new skills.
However, 9 weeks without human contact starts to consume more and more of your sanity. 
Finally you see 2 signs: “Fharswith 40km” and “Riverfoot Keep 160km”.
>> What do you think?
