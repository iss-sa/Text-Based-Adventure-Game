The End!(Tragic)
(K) Press K!
Swim to the Giants of Old.
After several weeks of travel you arrive at the river. It looks so wide! 
But there in the distance you see the giant mountains. 
You start swimming and at first everything is going well. 
However, soon you notice that your muscles arenâ€™t strong enough against the sea currents! 
The pull you farther and farther out to south sea. 
After a whole day of struggling you are too exhausted to continue holding yourself over water. You drown.
