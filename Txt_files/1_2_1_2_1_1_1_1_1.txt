(1) You might be a little in love with Lady Yanabél too.
(2) You might be a little in love with Lord Pjoter too. 
(3) This has all gone too fast!
Join the old Lady at Riverfoot Keep.
Riverfoot Keep is the richest Keep in the whole country, 
richer even than the Uriella Fortress. 
It is decorated with so much Gold, that it is also called 
the Golden Castle - The Golcastle Woodlands surrounding it 
are named after that nickname. 
The Keep is known for its rigid class system with the 
lower class mining the gold and the upper class spending it all. 
As you are accompanying the old Lady you automatically belong to 
the upper class. 
After the few winter months you have already received 2 
wedding proposals! Lord Pjoter and Lady Yanabél have both fallen 
in love with you. 

>> How do you feel?
