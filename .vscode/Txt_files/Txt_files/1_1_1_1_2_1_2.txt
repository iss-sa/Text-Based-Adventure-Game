The End!(Happy)
(K) Press K!
You go to Fharswith.
People! As soon as you arrive you talk to as many people as possible. 
The more you learn from them, the happier you get that you didn't continue your journey:
The Rulers of riverfoot Keep, also called “The Golden Castle” are very cruel 
to the lower class. There are Rebels hiding in the Starving Marshes ambushing anyone on the road. 
You stay in Fharswith for several months before you decide to go back to Hyghel. 
You live the rest of your life with your foster family.
