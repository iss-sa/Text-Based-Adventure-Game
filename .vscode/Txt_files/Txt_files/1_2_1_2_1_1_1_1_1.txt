(1) Lord Pjoter has the most beautiful eyes and you have so much in common with him, you might be a little in love with him too
(2) Lady Yanabél is the funniest person you know and can debate you into the ground, you might be a little in love with her too 
(3) This has all gone too fast!    You don’t want to marry either, and you are sick of Riverfoot Keep
Join the old Lady at Riverfoot Keep.
Riverfoot Keep is the richest Keep in the whole country, richer even than the Uriella Fortress. 
It is decorated with so much Gold, that it is also called the Golden Castle. 
The Golcastle Woodlands surrounding it are named after that nickname. 
The Keep is known for its rigid class system. The lower class mines the gold and the upper class spends it all. 
As you are accompanying the old Lady you automatically belong to the upper class. 
After the winter months you have received 2 wedding proposals. Lord Pjoter and Lady Yanabél have both fallen in love with you. 
>> How do you feel?
